## About the Q&A
Q&A is enabled for this Hangout. To ask your question, click the Ask a new question button in the bottom-right corner of your screen.

You can enter your questions at any point during the hangout. Keep in mind that it takes about 50 seconds before the audio and video to make it through all the tubes to your computer, so by the time you've typed your question we may be on another topic. But don't worry! We've got the final half of the Hangout reserved just for Q&A.

We'll walk through building a VPC with public and private subnets, including:
