You can enter your questions at any point during the hangout. Keep in mind that it takes about 50 seconds before the audio and video to make it through all the tubes to your computer, so by the time you've typed your question we may be on another topic. But don't worry! We've got the final half of the Hangout reserved just for Q&A.
